🧠 AZHAR SHAKEEL
AI Researcher & Full-Stack Architect | The Radiant Architect
"Merging Linux stability with AI intelligence. I engineer robust systems where code meets consciousness."

I specialize in Supervised AI Systems and Full-Stack Engineering. I build complete web ecosystems where the foundation is solid HTML/CSS/JavaScript, scaled by modern frameworks only when needed.

My Unique Approach:
I apply the philosophy of the perfect Linux system to my software: Stable, Efficient, and Powerful. I don't build bloated apps; I engineer precision tools that run smooth and feel effortless.

💎 Core Expertise
🤖 AI Research (The Brain)

Supervised Learning: Architecting high-accuracy models using Python.
Stable Intelligence: Building AI systems that are reliable and predictable, not experimental.
Efficiency: Optimizing models to run like a well-tuned kernel—fast and resource-smart.
💻 Web Engineering (The Body)

Core Foundation: Expert-level HTML5, CSS3, & Vanilla JavaScript. I build from the ground up for performance.
Scalable Architecture: Implementing React and Node.js only when the project requires it—keeping the system light.
Database & Real-time: Leveraging Supabase for secure auth and database management.

🚀 The Philosophy
"The Perfect Distro Structure"
Just like a rock-solid Linux distribution, my code is engineered for stability over bloat.

Lightweight Code: No unnecessary dependencies.
Heavy Stability: Systems that don't crash.
User Power: Tools that are easy to use but incredibly capable.
🔭 What I Build
I am constantly building proprietary systems that merge AI with robust web interfaces.

🧠 Stable AI Web Apps: Applications where AI intelligence runs smoothly alongside frontend logic.
🚀 High-Performance Sites: Engineering responsive, fast-loading websites using core web technologies.
⚙️ Backend Pipelines: Creating efficient data flows that power intelligent user experiences.
