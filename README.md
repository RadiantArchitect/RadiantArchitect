🧠 AZHAR SHAKEEL
AI Researcher & Full-Stack Architect | The Radiant Architect
"Linux-grade stability fused with Neural Intelligence. Architecting logic, not just syntax."

My power lies in Research and Architectural Insight. I do not follow trends; I analyze the real-world problem and deploy the precise solution—Supervised Learning, Unsupervised discovery, or LLM integration—based on what the data actually requires.

I engineer custom algorithms for mid-weight systems. Code meets consciousness here. I rely on my own discoveries and a hidden arsenal of tools to build systems that are stable, predictable, and powerful. I am a relentless self-learner, balancing Open Source principles with proprietary innovations that I keep hidden until they are perfect.

💎 Core Expertise
🤖 The Researcher's Mind

Precision Mapping: I map real-world complexity to the exact logic required: Supervised, Unsupervised, or LLM.
Custom Algorithms: I design tailored solutions from scratch rather than relying on bloated libraries.
The Hidden Arsenal: Leveraging self-discovered, non-standard tools and scripts for performance that goes beyond mainstream capabilities.
Self-Experimentation: My workflow is built on rigorous testing and discovery, ignoring industry hype.
💻 Web Engineering (The Body)

Core Foundation: Expert-level HTML5, CSS3, & Vanilla JavaScript.
Scalable Architecture: Implementing React and Node.js only when needed—keeping the system light.
Database & Real-time: Leveraging Supabase for secure auth and database management.

🚀 The Philosophy
"The Mid-Weight Architecture"
I reject the extremes of modern engineering.

Anti-Fragility: I reject "ultra-lightweight" systems that sacrifice stability for minimalism.
Anti-Bloat: I reject "sugar-coated" systems that hide bad code behind shiny interfaces.
The Standard: I engineer Mid-Weight Systems. I keep the full power and logic required for stability, but ruthlessly cut the bloat.
🔭 What I Build & Write
I am currently focused on proprietery research, operating part-time on my own terms.

🧠 Stable AI Web Apps: Custom algorithms integrated into robust web interfaces.
🚀 High-Performance Sites: Responsive, fast-loading websites using core technologies.
📝 Technical Blogs: Writing concise, personal insights on my discoveries and engineering experiments—sharing knowledge, not fluff.

⛔ Availability
Currently Closed to Noise.
I am not accepting clients, calls, or "chats to pick my brain" at the moment. My time is dedicated to personal projects, research, and self-experimentation.
