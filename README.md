# 🌐 Radiant Architect — AI Researcher & Full-Stack Engineer

Hi, I’m **[AZHAR SHAKEEL]**, an AI Researcher & Full-Stack Engineer — often known as the **Radiant Architect** for building systems with clarity, precision, stability, and disciplined design.

My engineering philosophy comes from **powerful Linux systems** I fell in love with when I first studied them.  
Not “just minimal,” but **stable, optimized, predictable, and engineered with intention**.

I’ve been doing tech since childhood, and today I build systems that grow as I grow —  
light in footprint, heavy in stability, designed to last.

## ⚡ What I Build
- Full-stack applications (frontend → backend → CI/CD)
- Supervised AI systems optimized for **compute efficiency + stability**
- High-precision backend logic powered by **Python**
- Modern backend infrastructure using **Supabase** (auth, DB, APIs, real-time)
- Systems engineered with Linux-style discipline and clarity

---

## 🧠 Engineering Principles
- **Powerful Linux Philosophy:** modular, predictable, stable  
- **Optimized Compute:** performance through tuning, profiling, and clarity  
- **Security-First:** auditable logic, least-privilege, clean architecture  
- **Human-Centered Simplicity:** powerful systems that feel effortless

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
**Frontend:** HTML · CSS · JavaScript · Bootstrap · TypeScript · React  
**Backend:** Python (primary) · Node.js · Supabase  
**Infrastructure:** Linux · Docker · CI/CD  
**ML:** Supervised learning systems engineered for low/medium compute

## 🔭 Current Focus
- Building stable AI pipelines  
- Designing powerful low-compute systems  
- Architecting real-time apps with Supabase  
- Teaching through first-principles clarity

## 🌱 About Me
Most of my time isn’t spent “working.”  
It’s spent **building, experimenting, and architecting** real systems —  
the way the Radiant Architect should.
