🧠 AZHAR SHAKEEL
AI Researcher & Full-Stack Architect | The Radiant Architect
"Bridging Core Web Engineering with High-Precision AI."

I specialize in Supervised AI Systems engineered for stability. I build complete web ecosystems where the foundation is solid HTML/CSS/JavaScript, scaled by modern frameworks only when needed.

I am constantly active—building, deploying, and refining my own projects to bring intelligence to the web.

💎 Core Expertise
🤖 AI Research (The Brain)

Supervised Learning: Architecting accurate, low-compute models using Python.
System Logic: High-precision backend algorithms designed for stability.
Optimization: Tuning models for efficiency on real-world infrastructure.
💻 Web Engineering (The Body)

Core Foundation: Expert-level HTML5, CSS3, & Vanilla JavaScript. I build from the ground up for performance and clarity.
Scalable Architecture: Implementing React and Node.js specifically when project complexity requires it—not just for the sake of it.
Database & Real-time: Leveraging Supabase for secure auth, database management, and APIs.
🛠️ The Tech Stack
💻 Core Frontend
HTML5 · CSS3 · JavaScript (ES6+)

⚛️ Framework Layer
React · Node.js · TypeScript

🤖 AI & Backend
Python · Supabase · API Design

📦 Infrastructure
Linux · Docker · CI/CD

🔭 Active Projects
I am deeply engaged in building proprietary systems that merge AI with robust web interfaces.

🧠 AI-Integrated Web Apps: Deploying supervised models directly into JavaScript-driven frontends.
🚀 High-Performance Sites: Engineering lightweight, responsive websites using core web technologies.
⚙️ Backend Pipelines: Creating stable data flows that power intelligent user experiences.
🚀 The Philosophy
I adhere to the Linux Philosophy: Use the right tool for the job. I start with the core—HTML, CSS, JS—and layer complexity only when the architecture demands it.

I build for longevity, not just for trends.
